# Useless Magento2 module

### Description

This test module doesn't have any real practical functions and has been created to demonstrate how to use the following Magento 2 functionality:
- Creating custom UI elements (grids, forms);
- Creating and updating custom tables with migrations (InstallSchema and UpgradeSchema);
- Creating custom API routes (REST and SOAP);
- Creating plugins;
- Creating custom console commands;
- Keep module settings in system settings table (`core_config_data`); 

### Requirements
- PHP >=7.1 (were used type declarations for parameters and return values, was used NULL type);
- Magento >= 2.3 (I haven't tested this module with previous Magento versions).
